The program is to do these following functions.

Calculate the frequency of each character in the file.

Construct a Huffman Tree based on these frequencies.

Use the tree to encode the characters into binary codes.

Compress the file by replacing characters with their binary codes.

Save the Huffman Code information in a .hi file.

Decompress the file by using the Huffman Tree to decode the binary codes back into characters.
